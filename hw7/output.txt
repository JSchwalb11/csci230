I have a spelling checker,
It came with my P C.
It plainly skip marks for my review,
Mistakes skip I can not see.
I strike the keys and type a word,

And wait for it to say,
Whether I am write or wrong,
It tells me straight away.
I ran this poem through it,
You're sure real glad to know.
It's very polished in its way.
My checker told me so.
A checker is a blessed thing,
It frees you loads of time.
It helps me write all styles of writing,

And aids me when I rhyme.
Each phrase composed skip up on my screen,
I trusted to be a jewel.
The checker pours over every word,
To check some spelling rule.
